Spanning tree is a sub-graph of a graph having n nodes and (n-1) edges. 
ie. No cycle in spanning tree.

we can make spanning tree from a graph of all nodes are connected

Both Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithm finds the Minimum Spanning Tree and 
follow the Greedy approach of problem-solving.

Kruskal’s algorithm’s time complexity is O(E log V), V being the number of vertices.

Prim’s algorithm has a time complexity of O(V2), V being the number of vertices and can be improved up to O(E log V) using Fibonacci heaps.
