''' 
Analysis of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

Building the distances dictionary takes O(V)O(V) time since we add every vertex in the graph to the dictionary.

The while loop is executed once for every entry that gets added to the priority queue. An entry can only be added when we explore an edge, so there are at most O(E)O(E) iterations of the while loop.

The for loop is executed at most once for every vertex, since the current_distance > distances[current_vertex] check ensures that we only process a vertex once. The for loop iterates over outgoing edges, so among all iterations of the while loop, the body of the for loop executes at most O(E)O(E) times.

Finally, if we consider that each priority queue operation (adding or removing an entry) is O(\log E)O(logE), we conclude that the total running time is O(V + E \log E)O(V+ElogE).
# Time: O(V * E * log(E))
