For learning Dynamic Programming, we need to relate the concepts learned in one question to apply to another problemðŸ’¡. If we try to learn DP without any proper process then it would be very hard to learn. [Aditya Verma's](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdityaVermaTheProgrammingLord)  [dynamic programming playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go) on youtube is a great resource to learn DP from the basicsðŸ™Œ. 
In this [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/SamirPaul1/DSAlgo/tree/main/02_Dynamic-Programming) section, you can find all the questions covered in Aditya Verma's DP playlist folder-wise with my [handwritten notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamirPaul1/DSAlgo/main/02_Dynamic-Programming/Dynamic-Programming-NOTE.pdf). 
I have also added some extra concepts asked in top product based companies.ðŸŽ¯
